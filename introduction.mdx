## Overview

Welcome to Tolt's API documentation. Our API enables you to programmatically manage your partnership program, including partners, commissions, transactions, and more. The API follows RESTful principles and uses standard HTTP methods.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.tolt.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

You can find your API key in the [Settings -> Integrations](https://app.tolt.io/settings?tab=integrations) tab.

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format and include a `success` boolean indicating if the request was successful.

### Successful Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "part_s7mbzRGn46BhVgNFHD6fDgXW",
    "first_name": "Michael",
    "last_name": "Scott"
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key provided",
    "type": "authentication_error"
  }
}
```

- `limit`: Number of records to return (default: 10, max: 100)
