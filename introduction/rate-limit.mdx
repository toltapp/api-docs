## Overview

The Tolt API implements rate limiting to ensure stability and fair usage across all users. Rate limits are applied on a per-API key basis.

## Current Limits

<Card title="Rate Limits">
  **25 requests per second**

</Card>

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again.",
    "type": "rate_limit_error"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

To work effectively within these limits:

1. **Implement Retries**

   - Use exponential backoff when you receive a 429 response
   - Wait for the duration specified in the error message before retrying

2. **Monitor Usage**

   - Track the rate limit headers in your responses
   - Set up alerts when you're approaching limits
   - Consider implementing your own request throttling

3. **Optimize Requests**
   - Batch operations when possible
   - Cache responses when appropriate
   - Use webhook notifications instead of polling
