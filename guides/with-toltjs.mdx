## Tracking Flow

### 1. Click Tracking

The tolt.js script automatically tracks visitors that come through partner links:

- When a visitor arrives through an partner link, tolt.js creates a click
- The click data is accessible through `window.tolt_data`:

```javascript
{
  click_id: "30aa8b8d-b846-4827-bd6f-6beb16466841",
  cookie_duration: 30,
  partner_id: "f468da94-f786-485c-9314-3008ce472188",
  program_id: "prg_YRsbPDAKhWAdqJbFACheh",
  customer_id: null  // Will be set after signup
}
```

### 2. Lead Tracking

When a visitor signs up, convert them to a lead using the signup function:

```javascript
const result = await window.tolt.signup("user@example.com");
// Returns signup data including customer_id
```

After signup, store the `customer_id` and `partner_id` from `window.tolt_data` in your database. You'll need these to track future payments for this customer.

### 3. Payment Tracking

When the customer makes a payment, call the [create a transaction](/transactions/create) API:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.tolt.com/v1/transactions' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "amount": 9999,
    "customer_id": "cust_dK9bzRGn46BhVgNFHD6fDgXW",
    "billing_type": "subscription",
    "charge_id": "ch_9bzRGn46BhVgNFHD6fDgXW",
    "product_name": "Premium Plan",
    "source": "stripe",
    "interval": "month"
}'
```

When a transaction is created, Tolt automatically:

1. Identifies the associated partner through the customer_id
2. Triggers the programs commission flows
3. The flows will create a commission record for the partner if the conditions are met

This completes the tracking cycle from initial click through to paid commission.
