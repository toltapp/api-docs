## Tracking Flow

### 1. Click Tracking

When a visitor arrives through an partner link (e.g., `yourdomain.com?ref=partner123`), call the [create a click](/clicks/create) API:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.tolt.com/v1/clicks' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "param": "ref",
    "value": "partner123",
    "page": "https://yourdomain.com/product",
    "device": "desktop"
}'
```

If the param & value combination doesn't exist in your program, the API will return an error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Link not found"
}
```

On success, store the returned `partner_id` - you'll need it to create the customer later.

### 2. Lead Tracking

When the visitor signs up, [create a customer](/customers/create) using the stored `partner_id`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.tolt.com/v1/customers' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "partner_id": "part_s7mbzRGn46BhVgNFHD6fDgXW",
    "customer_id": "your_internal_user_id"
}'
```

Store the returned `customer_id` alongside your user data - you'll need it for tracking payments.

### 3. Payment Tracking

When the customer makes a payment, [create a transaction](/transactions/create) using the stored `customer_id`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.tolt.com/v1/transactions' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "amount": 9999,
    "customer_id": "cust_dK9bzRGn46BhVgNFHD6fDgXW",
    "billing_type": "subscription",
    "charge_id": "ch_9bzRGn46BhVgNFHD6fDgXW",
    "product_name": "Premium Plan",
    "source": "stripe",
    "interval": "month"
}'
```

When a transaction is created, Tolt automatically:

1. Identifies the associated partner through the customer_id
2. Triggers the programs commission flows
3. The flows will create a commission record for the partner if the conditions are met

This completes the tracking cycle from initial click through to paid commission.
