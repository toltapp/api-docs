description: "Programs are distinct affiliate marketing campaigns that you can manage separately.
Each program can have its own name, website URL, unique subdomain, resources, commission structure and branded partner portal.
This flexibility allows you to tailor different programs to specific audiences or affiliates (e.g. Agency Partners and Influencers)."
